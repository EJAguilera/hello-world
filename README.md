Respecting the tradition.

I'm Elisha Aguilera, currently studying at Washington State University Everett (formerly Washington State University North Pudget Sound), majoring in Software Engineering. Aside from reading documentation, I have a passion for creation, human-computer interactions, and as of now Bonsai trees.
